# Ants-War
A game made by a group of students in Damascus University. Built from scratch using C++ and Legacy OpenGL.

You are a fighter inside the computer environment, and you see ants attacking the chips, so you have to kill them using the ball to save your computer.

Controls:
- N,F To turn Lighting on/off
- O to enter a chip (You must be in front of its door)

- W, A, S, D for walking 
- arrows for changing view angle
- left mouse click to hit the ant using the ball
- R to restart the game if you got killed
